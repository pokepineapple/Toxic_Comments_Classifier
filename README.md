# Toxic_Comments_Classifier

Contributors: Andre Cutuli, Linh Trinh, Brenda Van Riper

Description: 

Contains portion of the Toxic_Comments_Classifier Project that Andre contributed working on the RRN Model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The repopository contains the data sets used for training and testing the model, model versions.

Files:

classifying-hate-comments.ipynb - first iteration of the RNN model 

classifying-hate-comments_v1.ipynb - updated RRN Model along with breakdown of data cleaning and training

cleanedtest.zip - contains cleanedtest.csv for testing results after model training

jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.zip - contains jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv for cleaning data before training and validating the model

note.txt - observations made while examining the data during cleaning. Additional notes made regarding issues of Overfitting that occurred and its solutions implemented.
